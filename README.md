Before completing the project:
With this project I plan to put my HTML knowledge into practice. Again. This is the 2nd time I'm doing this project. I plan to coming back to it and spice it up with CSS and maube even JavaScript in the future. I feel like I have a pretty good intuition with the most commonly used tags but practice makes perfect. I also plan to gain more intuition with Git and GitHub.
